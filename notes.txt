Attributes:
	speed - place in the turn order (units with the same "turn order" go at the same time?)
	intimidation - likelyhood of being attacked
	distance - range of attack (unit is assumed to be at this distance away from then "front line")
	splash - how many units are effected in a "group"
	physical power - limits damage with physical weapons
	magical power - limits damage with magical weapons

Definitions:
	turn order - the order in which units act.  units are grouped by speed and ordered from highest to lowest
	front line - the "group" closest to the front
	group - units for each side are grouped by distance


Units are grouped by distance and ordered by intimidation.  
In the figure below, the bottom side has no more 0 distance 
units so the next closest group of units have a range of 1.  
They are now on the front line.  The top side will now 
attack the bottom side front line (distance 1) with their 
highest speed against the highest intimidation.

OOOOO                     4 distance
-
OOO                       2 distance
-
OOOOO                     0 distance
========================= front line
OOOOO                     1 distance
-
OOO                       3 distance

Each unit can be set to train one attribute.  The amount of 
training a unit can do can depend on the item they are using.  
An example would be the range of a weapon limiting how much 
a unit could train distance.
